                Hi, my name is Madeleine and I'm an aspiring software engineer
                from Somerset, England.
                <h3>Why does your website look like this?</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon researching personal websites, a lot of the ones that I
                    came across looked the same: all using the latest 'optimal'
                    tech-stack; having a light/dark mode toggle; each spouting
                    their childhood passion for software engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's why I wanted my portfolio to look like this - a bit
                    different. Because I am a bit different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't fall in love with programming as a child nor was
                    Computer Science my favourite subject since school. I don't
                    have a million projects on my
                    <a href="https://github.com/hd2802">GitHub</a> and I didn't
                    create a graphics engine at the age of 15.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I do have, however, is a different perspective to
                    others. I studied both STEM and humanities subjects until I
                    had to choose one or the other. I have a passion for problem
                    solving in innovative ways and using my different
                    experiences to bring alternative ideas to situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a thirst for knowledge and love learning new things -
                    particularly in a hands-on way. If I am faced with a task, I
                    may not understand it straight away but I will work hard
                    until I do.
                </p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio.</p>
